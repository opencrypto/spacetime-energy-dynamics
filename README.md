# World Science: spacetime-energy-dynamics (SED)

Welcome to the World Science project on Spacetime Energy Dynamics (SED).

## Introduction to World Science Experiment

This initiative is an experimental approach to scientific development that we call World Science. In this experiment, we will try to develop a new fondamental scientific theory starting from the idea that spacetime is a dynamic energy field and open up the development to the world.

## Spacetime Energy Dynamics and General Relativity.

The area of work we picked for the experiment has both the advantage of being a well-known and well-studied field of physics and the disadvantage of being a very complex and difficult field where the contributions of many scientists are needed to make progress.

The goal of this project is to develop a new theory of spacetime energy dynamics and its relationship with general relativity and quantum field theory. The core intuition at the center of this experiment is based on the idea that spacetime is a dynamic energy field that is constantly changing and evolving where the conservation of energy is not a local property but a global one.

This theory is an attempt to unify the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single, coherent framework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized according to the stages of the project. Each stage represents a milestone in the development of the theory and is organized in a separate folder. For example, the first stage is the development of the basic concepts of the theory, the second stage is the development of the mathematical framework, and so on.

All referenced papers, articles, and other resources are stored in the `resources` folder.

The repository is organized as follows:
