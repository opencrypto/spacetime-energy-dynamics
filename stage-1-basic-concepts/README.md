# Stage 1: Basic Concepts

The first stage of the project is the development of the basic concepts of the theory. This stage is focused on defining the core ideas and principles that will form the foundation of the theory.

## Tasks

- [ ] Develop an initial description of the theory.
- [ ] Define examples of spacetime energy dynamics in one dimension.
- [ ] Introduction to the non-local conservation of energy in spacetime.
- [ ] Develop thought experiments to illustrate the theory.
- [ ] Write a paper on the basic concepts.
- [ ] Implement a simple simulation of the theory.
- [ ] Write tests for the simulation.
- [ ] Document the simulation.
